net_device=$(ip route | awk '/via/ {print $5}')
TRANSMITTED=$(ifconfig "$net_device" | awk '/TX packets/ {print $6$7}')
=$(ifconfig "$net_device" | awk '/RX packets/ {print $6$7}')

printf "%s\n" "$(tput bold)ðŸ“¼ TRANSMITTED $(tput sgr0): $TRANSMITTED"
printf "%s\n" "$(tput bold)ðŸ“¡ RECEIVED $(tput sgr0): $RECEIVED"
